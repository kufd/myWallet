 * Remember to validate data before saving to database. Some validation rules are already taken care of by the _fields declaration.
 * Min_length and max_length are set for both username and password, both these fields are already required, and the username
 * will be checked on uniqueness. However, you might want to add additional rules to validate if username is alphanumeric for example.
